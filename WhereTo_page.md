### WhereTo?

 
**A MODE-7 Temple Runner Game Project**  
In this finished project i used another... another dope feature of love2d,  
<b>"SHADERS"</b>.  
Through the use of this feature and some really cool libraries made by some guys at the forum,  
I was able to create a very well polished temple runner game  
that uses the MODE-7(you should probably google this yourself) old trick.

Some of the features of the game include: 
-saving and loading alot of stuff  
-in game shopping system  
-character selection  
-awesome reward on completing the game(unlocking everything)  
-and more...  

I also made a local leaderboard <b>database</b> with python [here]()  
where i keep a record of the people with the highest score.  
Feel free to send your best score and your name to any of my contacts if you want your score there.   


All the obstacles were drawn by my bro, but the characters are  
from online sources with a little tweaking of my own


The code lives [here](https://github.com/Rocket-007/WhereTo) and the apk [here]()

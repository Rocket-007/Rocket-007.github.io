## Love2d/Lua Projects

**Project description:**  This page consists of Love2d and Lua Project that i have made  


Towards the end of the lock down at my state (august/september 2020),  
I finally came to the realization that... man... I gotta do something.  

But what could a 16 year old aspired game developer do with his low end phone([how low end?](/myPhoneSpec)).  
After a hundred google searches later,  
I came across a stackover flow comment where some one mention IT!!!! "LOVE2D" (litrally just like that)   
So what is this **"love2d"**,  

Well love2d is this very dope multiplatform game framework(not game engine) that is  
essencially used for making 2d games,  
but if you are crazy like me and some of the love2d game developers at the folrum you could even  
make 3d games with it that go wayyyy beyond the bounds of this mode7 temple runner game i made [here]().  

Ok back to the explanation...,  
and because love2d is multiplatform, the framework developers also made a andriod app of the framework(wowwww), so  
meaning that you dont really have to use a pc to run the code,  
you can aswell run  it on you android and ios device (double woooow).  


Love2d uses a Lua programing language for its scripting(much like how pygame uses python for scripting and unity uses c# or and c++)  
And just like that my jorney with _love_ began  

if you want to try it out you can download the app on app store of playstore. i made use of "droid edit" for coding so  
you should probably get that too  

**so here are some of my code, projects and games/apps i have to show off**

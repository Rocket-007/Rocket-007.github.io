### Pygame::

Pygame is a well known framework or library(depending on who you ask) of python that is used for 2D game development.  
Luckily there is a python app call "Pydroid 3" which comes with the pygame framework integrated into it, which is what i used to learn and program  
with [my mobile phone](/myPhoneSpec_page).  

I already deeply learnt love2d and lua before pygame and python so transfering the code knowledge, structure and  
problem solving skills really helped me alot to progress faster (than the average bear ;-) ).

####Missle attack  
This was litrally the FIRST mini game project... thing i did on pygame.  
i went abit through a little blog tutorial I saw online,  
then I (creatively) added extra stuff like shooting and fire coming out of your ship :-)  
<i>side note... this first mini pygame... game of mine was done in 3 days (including the drawing of the crukked assets)...</i>  
<br><br>
I think I'll make a tutorial of mine on how it was made (the code, classes stuff and then the assets)  


The code is over [here](https://github.com/Rocket-007/PyGAME/tree/main/missle%20WAR)

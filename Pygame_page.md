### Pygame::

Pygame is a well known framework or library(depending on who you ask) of python that is used for 2D game development.  
Luckily there is a python app call "Pydroid 3" which comes with the pygame framework integrated into it, which is what i used to learn and program  
with [my mobile phone](/myPhoneSpec_page).  

BTW, I already deeply used love2d and lua before pygame and python so transfering the code knowledge, structure and  
problem solving skills really helped me alot to progress faster (than the average bear ;-)).  

		\missle attack
		this was litrally the FIRST mini game project... thing i did.
		i went through this tutoral here, then added more stuff like shooting and fire coming out of your ship :-)
		side note... this first pygame game of mine was done in 3 days (including the assetd)... 
		what can i say,am a fast learner
		i think ill make a tutorial on how it was made (the code and classes stuff then the assets)
		the code is over here

		\cube-E(runner cube)
		This was made by me following this tutorial [here](). but i added touch/mouse support were now the cube moves
		towards were the mouse/touch is.
		and i also added a weird class thing concerning the enemy
		  mso that now i can easily added more enemies with
		different attributes
		side note this was done in less than 7 hrs (including following the tutorial... fast learner here)
		my code is here

### Pygame::

Pygame is a well known framework or library(depending on who you ask) of python that is used for 2D game development.  
Luckily there is a python app call "Pydroid 3" which comes with the pygame framework integrated into it, which is what i used to learn and program with [my mobile phone](/myPhoneSpec_page).<br><br>  

I already deeply learnt love2d and lua before pygame and python so transfering the code knowledge, structure and  
problem solving skills really helped me alot to progress faster (than the average bear ;-) ).

#### Missle attack  
This was litrally the FIRST mini game project... thing i did on pygame.  
I went abit through a little blog tutorial I saw online,  
then I (creatively) added extra stuff like shooting and fire coming out of your ship :-)  
<i>side note... this first mini pygame... game of mine was done in 3 days (including the drawing of the crukked assets)...</i>  
<br><br>
I think I'll make a tutorial of mine on how it was made (the code, classes stuff and then the assets)  

<br>

The code is over [here](https://github.com/Rocket-007/PyGAME/tree/main/missle%20WAR)

#### Squary  
Just a Square running away from red boyz.  
I also went through a tutorial for this one but i added touch/mouse support were now the cube moves towards were the mouse/touch is.  

I also added a weird class thing concerning the enemy so that now i can easily added more enemies with different attributes (like speed and basic ai controls)
<i>side note this was done in less than 5 hrs (including following the tutorial... thanks to love) </i>  <br>

My code is [here](https://github.com/Rocket-007/PyGAME/tree/main/Squary)

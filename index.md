<i>Being an aspired game developer, what could I have done with <a href="myPhoneSpec">just my mobile phone</a>.<br>  
After some research,<br>  
I came across a stack overflow comment where someone mentioned "LOVE2D"<br><br>   
What is this <b>"love2d"</b>?,</i> 

</details>  

<br>

Love2d is a multiplatform game ~~engine~~ framework that uses the <b>Lua programing language</b> for  
its scripting.

It is essencially used for making <b>2d games</b>,  
but if you are crazy like me you could even make <b>3d games</b>,  
but it will definately take more time, effort and resouces to accomplish.  

The framework developers also made a <b>mobile app</b> of the framework,  
so meaning that you dont really have to use a pc to run the code,  
you can aswell run  it on you <b>android or ios device</b> (wow). This was exactly what i was looking for.   


You can try it out yourself. Download the app on app store or playstore. I made use of <b>"droid edit"</b> for the coding(an IDE)  
so you should probably get that too or any other IDE on mobile should work fine.  

<b>Here are some of my code, projects and games/apps i have to show off</b>

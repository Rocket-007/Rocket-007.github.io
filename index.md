### Love2d/Lua Projects: 

**Project description:**  This section of the page consists of Love2d and Lua Project that i have made  
and worked on.

<details>
  <summary>expand!?</summary>
 
_Towards the end of the lock down at my state (august/september 2020),  
I finally came to the realization that... man... I gotta do something._  

_But what could a 16 year old aspired game developer do with his low end phone([how low end?](/myPhoneSpec)).  
After a hundred google searches later,  
I came across a stackover flow comment where some one mention IT!!!! "LOVE2D" (litrally just like that)   
So what is this **"love2d"**,_  

</details>  

<br/>

Well love2d is this very dope **multiplatform ~~game engine~~ game framework** that is  
essencially used for making **2d games**,  
but if you are crazy like me and some of the love2d game developers at the folrum you could even  
make **3d games** with it thats go wayyyy beyond the bounds of this mode7 temple runner game i made [here](/WhereTo_page).  

Ok back to the explanation...,  
and because love2d is multiplatform, the framework developers also made a **andriod app** of the framework(wowwww), so  
meaning that you dont really have to use a pc to run the code,  
you can aswell run  it on you **android and ios device** (double woooow).  


Love2d uses a **Lua programing language** for its scripting(much like how pygame uses python for scripting and unity uses c# or and c++)  
And just like that my jorney with _love_ began  

if you want to try it out you can download the app on app store of playstore. i made use of **"droid edit"** for coding so  
you should probably get that too.  

**so here are some of my code, projects and games/apps i have to show off**

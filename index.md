### Love2d/Lua Projects: 

**Project description:**  This section of the page consists of Love2d and Lua Project that i have made  
and worked on.

<details>
  <summary>expand!?</summary>

<i>Being an aspired game developer, what could I have done with <a href="myPhoneSpec">my mobile phone</a>(did nt have a pc).<br>  
After some google searches,<br>  
I came across a stack overflow comment where someone mention IT!!!! "LOVE2D" (litrally just like that)<br><br>   
So what is this <b>"love2d"</b>,</i> 

</details>  

<br>

Love2d is a multiplatform game ~~engine~~ framework that uses the <b>Lua programing language</b> for  
its scripting(much like how pygame uses python for scripting and unity uses c# or and c++).  

It is essencially used for making <b>2d games</b>,  
but if you are crazy like me you could even make <b>3d games</b> that  
go wayyyy beyond the bounds of this mode7 temple runner game i made [here](/WhereTo_page),  
but it will definately take more time, effort and resouces to accomplish that.  

Because love2d is multiplatform, the framework developers also made a <b>andriod app</b> of the framework(wowwww),  
so meaning that you dont really have to use a pc to run the code,  
you can aswell run  it on you <b>android and ios device</b> (double woooow). This was exactly what i was looking for.   


You try it out yourself. Download the app on app store or playstore. I made use of <b>"droid edit"</b> for the coding(an IDE)  
so you should probably get that too.  

<b>Here are some of my code, projects and games/apps i have to show off</b>

### 2d Blobs(fisrt game)

 
**A 2d platformer shooter game(with cool and bright graphics)**  
This is the very first well pulished game progect i made while learnig love 2d and programing on my mobile.  

Others would have gone for something simple like astroids or a very basic platfomer (with a white cube as the player)  
for there first game,  
but i dont know what came into me that made me choose such a big project at the very early stage of me learning love2d.  

It was terrible but exciting and ~~fun~~ _trilling_ but still verrry terrrriblee(sooo mannnny buggggs and errrorsss and issues and... arghh!!).  

Mind you this project is done entirely without a pc.  
There were very big issues like:  

-map editing  
-enemy spawnig  
-gamestates design  
-sound implementation  
-enemy ai  
-game controls  
-ui design  
-character selection  
-apk packaging and signing...  

...But surpisingly even without the pc after <b>2 MONTHS</b> i finished the game project,  
with a ton of help form my brother in the arts department(<3 U bro)

### 2d Blobs(fisrt game)

 
**A 2d platformer shooter game(with cool and bright graphics)**  
This is the very first well pulished game progect i made while learnig love 2d and programing on my mobile.  

Others would have gone for something simple like astroids or a very basic platfomer (with a white cube as the player)  
for there first game,  
but I game myself a way bigger project even it being at the very early stage of me learning love2d and lua.  

It was terrible but exciting and ~~fun~~ _trilling_ but still verrry terrrriblee(sooo mannnny buggggs and errrorsss and issues and... arghh!!).  

Mind you this project is done entirely without a pc.  
There were very big issues like:  

-map editing  
-gamestates design  
-sound implementation  
-graphics design and assets creation 
-enemy ai  
-game controls  
-ui design  
-character selection  
-apk packaging and signing...  

...But surpisingly even without a pc after <b>2 MONTHS</b> i finished the game project,  
with a ton of help form my brother in the arts department(<3 u bro)

<b>Below are some of the screenshots of the game s development and progress with description</b>

Fixing a very terrible bug that threatened the project at the early stage of development.  
The playing would clip a small piece of it self to the left to corner of the screen, leaving the wireframe of the collision blocks.  
The bug happened when i (inevitably) scaled the camera aand map to values like 0.1, 0.2,...0.9 <br>

More progress...  
BTW, one mobile there is no windows or menu for debugging on the console so i have to <b>manually</b>  
place my variables on the screen so i can debug, and thats why my screen is so messy in development<br>

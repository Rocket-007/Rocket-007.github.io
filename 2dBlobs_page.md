### 2d Blobs(fisrt game)

 
**A 2d platformer shooter game(with cool and bright graphics)**  
This is the very first well pulished game progect i made while learnig love 2d and programing __on my mobile.__  

Others would have gone for something simple like astroids or a very basic platfomer (with a white cube as the player),  
but i dont know what came into me that made me choose such a big project at the very early stage of me learning love2d.  

It was terrible but exciting and fun but still verrry terrrriblee(sooo mannnny buggggs and errrorsss and issues and... arghh!!).  

Mind you this project is done entirely **without a pc.**  
There were big issues like:  

-map editing  
-enemy spawnig  
-gamestates design  
-sound implementation  
-enemy ai  
-game controls  
-ui design  
-character selection...  

...But surpisingly after **2 MONTHS** i finished the game project, with a ton of help form my brother in the arts department

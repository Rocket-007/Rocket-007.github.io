### WeDraw

 
**A Mutiplayer Drawing Project**  
This is basically the second project i worked on for close to a month after [2d Blobs](/2dBlobs_page).  
Its actually one of my dream apps/game that I plan on continueing/recreating when I switch to an engine.  

This project was where I used another dope feature of Love2d, **"NETWORKING"**.  
Through the use of this feature and some really cool	libraries made by some guys at the folrum,  

_I made a local multiplayer drawing project that would allow two or more devices  
to draw on a canvas while also previewing the intups and updated the canvas in real time._  

I wont go in depth on how the code works but **BaSicALiy**  
each pen stroke is generated form drawing lines continiously on the moving path  
while also storing those line cordinates in tables variables  
that would be read and sent through  
the local network to the server which will  
then send these packets to each client so that those clients would  
also draw the cordinates of all the other clients stoke input on the network.  

I drew the assets myself **with my phone**(again), but the colour palletes were gotten from online sources  


A terrible accident happened that made me lose most of my files  
including the server file of the project  


you can view the code repository [here]()  


```lua
if isAwesome then
  return true
end
```

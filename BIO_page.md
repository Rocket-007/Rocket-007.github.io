### BIO-battle it out


**A VERY Unique multiplayer 2d platformer shooter**  
Alrighty..., take the 2d Blobs project [here](/2dBlobs_page) and the WeDraw project [here](/WeDraw_page),  
put them in a bowl and mix em together, then add... **A SPECIAL SAUCE!**,  
and you ve got **BIO**.  

It has some dope features like:  

-locally connecting devices together  
-shooting each other  
-blocking with the shield(it think it works)  
-cool day and night cycle(request for my bro)  
-score board  
-flying and jumping  
-dying and respawing  
-cool house in the middle of nowhere  
-etc...  



This actually is nt complete but i so much love the unique game mechanics that i will definately  
recreating it once i get a pc and switch to an engine  

Still, you can see the whole project code [here](https://github.com/Rocket-007/BIO-Battle-It-Out)
